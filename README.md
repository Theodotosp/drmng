# DRMng
DotD Raids Manager next gen

# Installation
* Ensure you have userscripts manager addon installed. For Firefox it's Greasemonkey, for almost all other browsers (Chrome/Safari/Opera/Edge) you'll  be using Tampermonkey.
* Open [kong_ng.user.js] file here on github and after that hit 'RAW' button. Userscripts manager should intercept file and allow installation/update.
* Make sure you don't have old script enabled (they don't play nice when run together).
* Reload tab with game for changes to take effect

# TODO
* Sidebar configuration
* Alliance chat
* Options framework (partially implemented atm)
* Configuration stored on server
